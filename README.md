# EU4 HRE game score calculator #

The code in this repository works on my Windows machine. It might need a little bit of tinkering to work on a Mac.

Requirements:
* A modern version of node.js (I'm using 12.13)
* Either NPM or Yarn

Installation:
1. Checkout the repository to your local machine
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` in the root of the project
3. Drop an EU4 save file into the root of the project
4. Run `yarn scores` or `npm run scores`
5. Wait a minute or two for it to process the __huge__ save file
6. You should get some scores (or an error!)
